How to improve the gyro.c program and gyromod kernel module


The gyro.c program requires the "gyromod" kernel module in order to start working. The module 
must be loaded before the program is executed. The program could be enhanced with one of the 
following functionalities: 
	- When the module is unloaded the program should stop working completely.
	- When the module is unloaded the program should be killed.

There are a couple improvements to be made in order to enhance the quality and readability of 
the code.
	- The MPU_Read() method has to many functionalities. New methods for creating and writing 
	  into file "gyro.dat" could be made.
	- How to data is written into the file "gyro.dat" could be adjusted.
	- Gyroscopes drift is unavoidable. In order to compensate the drift a kalman filter could be
	  implemented.

The kernel module "gyromod" could be enhanced with the following functionalities:
	- Parameters to set gyroscope sensitivity
	- Parameters to set accelerometer sensitivity
