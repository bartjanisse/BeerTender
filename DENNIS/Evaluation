Learning goals include the following:

	- Scrum methodology: 
		Understanding the importancy of the scrum roles, responsibilities and meetings.
		I think the scrum methods could be improved. The roles and responsibilities
		weren'	t always lived up to.

	- Wrting kernel modules for embedded linux:
		Understanding how to compile, write and use kernel modules for embedded linux.
		This element could have been more improved if there was more theoretical  and 
		practical support from the teacher.

	- Low level programming raspberry pi:
		Using the GPIO and other connectors.
     		Digital outputs: turn lights, motors, or other devices on or off
    		Digital inputs: read an on or off state from a button, switch, or other sensor
    		Communication with chips or modules using low-level protocols like IÂ²C

	- Understanding and interpreting and datasheets

It was a very interesting project which enclosed a lot of work. And a lot of work remains 
to be done!!
